# AkuAku

`v1.0.0`

My first adventure to modeling a character from a reference. My choice was [AkuAku](https://crash.fandom.com/es/wiki/Aku_Aku) from my beloved videogame series, [Crash Bandicoot](https://crash.fandom.com/es/wiki/Crash_Bandicoot_(Series)).

 It helped me to experiment with Lights creating a emission on the character's eyes and a light source on below character's head to add that *spooky* feeling.
